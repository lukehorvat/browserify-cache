# rememberify

File cache plugin for [browserify](http://browserify.org/).

Basically, this is just [watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify) without the file watch mode! Use this plugin if you're already listening for file system events via something like [gulp-watch](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-watch) or [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar), and want only the caching mechanism of watchify.
